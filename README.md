# Find Distance using the PixyCam

## Installation

Please read the information contained in the sketch, Instructable can be found here:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Using-a-PixyCam-CMUcam5-to-Get-Distance-of-a-Known

## Libraries

Because the Arduino IDE has been getting pretty bad handling libraries, I've included the libraries used in the src directory of the sketch. These libraries may have been slightly modified to work from the sketch directory, and do not include the examples.  

## Things To Do

Doesn't take much to setup, you will need a tape measure, some different color paper, card board, glue, a OLED or LCD display, and have the pixy mon software installed and working.
An Instructable will be posted, this is still a work in progress.

## Usage

Using the Pixy cam, and the size of a known object, we can find a distance from the camera. - The distances will be close, and should not be used for navigation (At least not yet).
